# data_visualizations
This is my GitHub repository for anything related to any data visualizations I make.
Right now, it will likely only contain files related to work I do as a data visualization editor for the Georgetown Public Policy Review.
However, I plan to expand and maintain it as I advance through my professional career.

This repository will include both datasets and visualizations.
